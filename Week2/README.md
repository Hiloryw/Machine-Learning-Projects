## Project's Contents:
    Iris.xls contains 150 data samples of three Iris categories, labeled by outcome values 0, 1, and 2. Each data sample has four attributes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Implement the K-means clustering algorithm to group the samples into K=3 clusters. Randomly choose three samples as the initial cluster centers. Calculate the objective function value J as defined in Problem 3 after the assignment step in each iteration. Exit the iterations if the following criterion is met: 𝐽(Iter − 1) − 𝐽(Iter) < ε, where ε = 10−5, and Iter is the iteration number. Plot the objective function value J versus the iteration number Iter.
